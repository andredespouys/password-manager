# Contributing to Password Manager

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Password Manager.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [issues](https://github.com/andredespouys/password-manager/issues) if there's something similar. If there isn't, you can open a new issue.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork Password Manager and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

# git checkout -b feature/325-add-japanese-localization

# Get the code

The first thing you need to do is to fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git

# Always be sure to pull upstream before creating a PR to be sure you have the most recent changes.

git pull upstream main
